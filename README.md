# Twitter Data Extraction
Exciting Twitter data analysis using Python's Twarc and Pandas! 

I've been exploring Python's powerful tools to fetch and analyze Twitter data, and I'm amazed by the possibilities!

In this project, I used the Twarc library to search for tweets with the hashtag #ManipurViralVideo. I then extracted relevant data and saved it into a JSON file.

Here's a summary of the code:

1. Import required libraries:
   - gzip: For handling gzip-compressed data.
   - json: For working with JSON data.
   - pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
   - datetime: To work with dates and times.
   - tqdm: For a neat progress bar to keep track of data retrieval.
   - twarc: A fantastic library to interact with the Twitter API.

2. Set up Twarc:
   I created a Twarc instance using my Twitter API credentials to access Twitter data.

3. Define the hashtag and date range:
   I specified the hashtag #ManipurViralVideo and calculated the date range to search for tweets within the last 10 days.

4. Fetch and save relevant tweets:
   I filtered tweets containing the hashtag and saved them along with their creation times to a list.

5. Create a DataFrame for analysis:
   Finally, I converted the list of tweets into a Pandas DataFrame, which will make data analysis a breeze!

Python, combined with Twarc and Pandas, made it effortless to process Twitter data efficiently. Now, I can dive into exciting insights and trends related to #ManipurViralVideo.

Happy coding and data exploration!
